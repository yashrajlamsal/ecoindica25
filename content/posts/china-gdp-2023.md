### Understanding China's GDP Composition

This China GDP breakdown follows the standard expenditure approach, with a special note on the pie chart visualization:

1.  **Investment** - Business capital expenditure and fixed asset investments
2.  **Consumption** - Household and private consumer spending
3.  **Government** - Public sector spending and services
4.  **Exports** - Goods and services sold to other countries
5.  **Imports** - Goods and services purchased from other countries (subtracted from GDP)

*Note: The "Pie Chart Percent" column shows normalized values where all components are displayed as positive percentages for visual clarity, while the "Percent of GDP" column reflects the actual economic contributions, including the negative value for imports.*

### Methodology and Data Sources

The GDP composition data follows the expenditure approach calculation method. Data is sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of China and the World Bank Development Indicators. The pie chart percentages are normalized versions of the actual GDP contributions to create a visually coherent chart.

*Note: The sum of individual components equals the total GDP in this dataset. Data represents the most recent available figures for 2024.*
