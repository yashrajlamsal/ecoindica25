We warmly welcome you to our website, which has been created by Yash Raj Lamsal, an assistant professor of economics at Kathmandu University. Our goal is to provide a top-notch educational experience to students, educators, and anyone interested in comprehending macroeconomic concepts, analyzing them, and presenting data through visually engaging charts and graphs. Our primary objective is to share up-to-date macroeconomic data and provide visual representations of it. Our main focus is publishing recent macroeconomic data and its visualization. The design of this website is based on the open  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme called  [Papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/).
